# ToDo Angular

This is an example of a ToDo project in Angular with use of an external API server. I wrote it to learn Angular and a modern JS.

## Get started

*Notice - this app needs a **backend app** which is available here: [ToDo Backend](https://github.com/ThomasK0lasa/todo-backend-example)*

Install dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start

```bash
npm start
```

**npm run dev** should automatically open your browser and navigate to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the app running.


# More examples in different frameworks

Other frameworks use same backend app and db in Mongo.
